##This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The goal is to demonstrate a complete data science workflow using a real-world dataset in a Jupyter Notebook, covering everything from data loading to model evaluation.

üéØ Objective:
To develop a supervised classification model that can automatically detect spam emails or SMS messages, based on their content, using Scikit-learn‚Äôs machine learning tools.

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn (modeling and evaluation)
Pandas (data handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations)
Natural Language Processing (CountVectorizer for text processing)
üì¶ Dataset:
Name: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle
Format: CSV file containing two columns:
label: spam or ham

message: the actual text message

üîÅ Workflow Steps:
Import Libraries

Load and Explore the Dataset

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Convert labels to binary

Text vectorization using CountVectorizer

Split Data into Training and Test Sets

Build a Classification Model

Algorithm used: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Train the Model

Make Predictions

Evaluate the Model

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Visualize Results

Test Custom Input

‚úÖ Deliverables:
A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file containing:

Complete code

Visualizations

Evaluation results

A trained model that can be used to classify new text messages
