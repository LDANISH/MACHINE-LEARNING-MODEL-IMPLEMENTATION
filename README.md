##This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The goal is to demonstrate a complete data science workflow using a real-world dataset in a Jupyter Notebook, covering everything from data loading to model evaluation.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To develop a supervised classification model that can automatically detect spam emails or SMS messages, based on their content, using Scikit-learnâ€™s machine learning tools.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used:
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn (modeling and evaluation)
Pandas (data handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations)
Natural Language Processing (CountVectorizer for text processing)
ðŸ“¦ Dataset:
Name: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle
Format: CSV file containing two columns:
label: spam or ham
